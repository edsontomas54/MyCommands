To install multiple PHP versions on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Add the "Ondřej Surý" PPA (Personal Package Archive)
This PPA allows you to access different PHP versions.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Different PHP Versions
Now, you can install multiple PHP versions. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php7.4
sudo apt install php8.0
sudo apt install php8.1
Step 3: Check Installed PHP Versions
You can check the installed PHP versions by running:

bash
Copy code
php -v
Step 4: Switch Between PHP Versions
To switch between PHP versions, use the update-alternatives command:

Configure PHP alternatives:

bash
Copy code
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.4
Or, for a different version:

bash
Copy code
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.0
You can also manually switch by listing available versions:

bash
Copy code
sudo update-alternatives --config php
You will be prompted to choose the default version from the available options.

Step 5: Configure Apache for Different PHP Versions (Optional)
If you're using Apache, you'll need to enable the appropriate PHP module and disable the others:

Disable the current PHP module:

bash
Copy code
sudo a2dismod php7.4
Enable the desired PHP module:

bash
Copy code
sudo a2enmod php8.0
Restart Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Step 6: Install PHP Extensions (if needed)
You can install PHP extensions for specific versions by appending the version number. For example, for PHP 7.4:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php7.4-mbstring php7.4-xml php7.4-curl
Repeat this for other versions as necessary.

This setup allows you to run multiple PHP versions on your system and easily switch between them.

Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires intervention/image dev-master, found intervention/image[dev-feature/fill-with-image, dev-feature/stream, dev-main, dev-develop, 1.0.0, ..., 1.6.x-dev, 2.0.0-beta, ..., 2.7.x-dev, 3.0.0-alpha.1, ..., 3.8.0] but these do not match your constraint and are therefore not installable. Make sure you either fix the constraint or avoid updating this package to keep the one present in the lock file (intervention/image[dev-master]).
  Problem 2
    - Root composer.json requires simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode ^2.0 -> satisfiable by simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode[2.0.0].
    - simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode 2.0.0 requires ext-gd * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's gd extension.
  Problem 3
    - phpunit/phpunit[6.0.0, ..., 6.5.14] require ext-dom * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's dom extension.
    - Root composer.json requires phpunit/phpunit ~6.0 -> satisfiable by phpunit/phpunit[6.0.0, ..., 6.5.14].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/php.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/10-opcache.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/10-pdo.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-calendar.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-ctype.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-exif.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-fileinfo.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-ftp.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-gettext.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-iconv.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-json.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-phar.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-posix.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-readline.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-shmop.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-sockets.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-sysvmsg.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-sysvsem.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-sysvshm.ini
    - /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/20-tokenizer.ini
You can also run php --ini in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd --ignore-platform-req=ext-dom to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.

To resolve the issues in your Composer setup, you need to install the missing PHP extensions (curl, gd, and dom). Here's how you can fix the issues step by step:

Step 1: Install PHP Extensions
Since you are using PHP 7.2, install the required extensions for that version. Run the following commands:

Install the curl extension:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php7.2-curl
Install the gd extension:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php7.2-gd
Install the dom extension (this is included in the xml package):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install php7.2-xml
Step 2: Enable the Extensions
Make sure the extensions are enabled in your PHP configuration. You can do this by:

Restarting your web server (Apache or Nginx) if you're using one:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Or for Nginx:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nginx
For the PHP CLI, check if the extensions are enabled by running:

bash
Copy code
php -m
Make sure curl, gd, and dom are listed. If not, enable them in the /etc/php/7.2/cli/php.ini file by adding the following lines (if not present):

ini
Copy code
extension=curl
extension=gd
extension=dom
Step 3: Run Composer Again
Now, try running Composer again:

bash
Copy code
composer install
This should resolve the issues regarding missing extensions.

Step 4: If You Want to Ignore the Platform Requirements
If for some reason you can't install the extensions at the moment, you can temporarily bypass the platform requirements by running:

bash
Copy code
composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd --ignore-platform-req=ext-dom
However, it’s best to install the extensions as they are required for your project to function correctly.

The error message indicates that the version constraint for intervention/image in your composer.json file is set to dev-master, but it no longer matches any available versions of the package.

To resolve this issue, you can take one of the following steps:

Option 1: Modify the Version Constraint in composer.json
Open your composer.json file.

Find the entry for intervention/image. It should look something like this:

json
Copy code
"require": {
    "intervention/image": "dev-master"
}
Change "dev-master" to a stable version that is available, such as "^2.7" (for the latest stable version in the 2.x series):

json
Copy code
"require": {
    "intervention/image": "^2.7"
}
After updating the version constraint, run:

bash
Copy code
composer update
This will fetch a compatible version of intervention/image and update your dependencies.

Option 2: Use the -W Option
If you want Composer to try upgrading or downgrading the locked packages based on the current constraints, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
composer update --with-all-dependencies
This will allow Composer to make adjustments to your dependencies to ensure compatibility across packages.

Option 3: Lock to a Specific Version
If you are aware of the specific version you want to lock intervention/image to, you can check available versions using:

bash
Copy code
composer show intervention/image --all
Pick a stable version and update your composer.json accordingly, then run composer update.

Option 4: Avoid Updating
If you don't want to change the current package version and wish to avoid updating it, you can run:

bash
Copy code
composer install
This will install the versions already defined in your composer.lock file, without making any updates.
