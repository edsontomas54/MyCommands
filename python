Once you're in the desired directory, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
 apt install python3.10-venv

python3 -m venv myenv
Replace myenv with the name you want to give to your virtual environment. This command will create a new directory called myenv in the current directory, which will contain the virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment by running the activation script. In the terminal, execute:
bash

source myenv/bin/activate
After activation, you'll notice that the prompt in your terminal changes, indicating that you're now working within the virtual environment.

You can now install packages and run Python scripts within this virtual environment without affecting the system-wide Python installation. For example, you can use pip to install packages:

pip install package_name
To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the global Python environment, simply execute:
Copy code
deactivate
