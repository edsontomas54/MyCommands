Change Ownership:
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to change the ownership of the project files to your user:
bash***
sudo chown -R your_username:your_username /path/to/your/project

Change Permissions:
If necessary, you might also need to adjust the file permissions. Run the following command to give your user read and write permissions:

bash**
chmod -R u+rw /path/to/your/project
This command grants read and write permissions to the owner (your user).

Now, your user should have the necessary permissions to modify files in your project without using sudo. If you encounter any issues related to permissions, you can address them by adjusting the ownership and permissions accordingly.

Keep in mind that modifying permissions and ownership should be done cautiously, especially on system-critical files. Only apply these changes to directories where it's necessary for your development work.
